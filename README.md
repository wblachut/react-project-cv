## Description

I made it! I have used `npx create-react-app cv-project` for the 1st time! Cool right?

This projects implements basic concepts of react. Building this application allowed to understand a new technology [React Framework](https://reactjs.org/). I've learned about `components`, `state` and `lifecycle methods`. You can change displayed information in the CV after changing mode to `edit` (first navbar button). In edit mode you can also add and delete new elements for skills, education and other categories. `Others.js `component was changed to be `functional component`. Have a look at the display bellow.
